# Tick, tock, &hellip;

Timer app. Sometimes you want to display time that is left on bigger screen. Idea for this app came on Reactive Conf 2015 when we needed to show time to speakers during their presentation. I haven't find any simple and nice solution for that. So I wrote one. If you think that you need this one, feel free to use it.

If you would like to add new style, then create new issue on Github, I will try to look at it.

## Tasks

- [ ] Make error message if there is bad input for time.
- [ ] Add option to change background color.
- [ ] Resolve issues with other browsers.
- [ ] Move dependencies to npm so it's easier to install.
- [ ] Add hot-reload/devel/build system (gulp/webpack).
- [ ] Create simple logo.
- [ ] Think and implement new styles for countdowns.
